<h2>Michael's Website Repo</h2>
<p>This is a repo meant to be used as a backup for Michael's website.</p>
<h2>Running the Website</h2>
<p>If you'd like to view the current status of the website, simply install or clone the repo, cd into the folder where the main files are housed, and run 'node server' and go to localhost:3000 in your browser.</p>
<p>This is the very early versions of this project so it will be revamped, changed, and other things.</p>
